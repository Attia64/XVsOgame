# X Vs O

A Tic Tac Toe game designed with Jetpack Compose




## OverView


This is my first project with Jetpack Compose. The app contains a single screen that records win scores,
draw times, and rounds played. It features smooth and simple animations, along with a current status display for the ongoing game.





## Project Goals


The aim of this project is to practice and enhance the skills I have learned in Jetpack Compose.
I challenged myself to recreate a random UI design from Behance as Compose code to test my abilities.
